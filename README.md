# Answer to practical problem
II. My answer is to iterate through a for loop 1000 times, check if i is divisible by 3 or 5, and add it to the sum if it is. The script is below:

sum = 0
for i in range(1, 1000):
      if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            sum += i
print(sum)
# Background Information
III. My name is Bora, I'm a first-year Health Data Science Master's student and this course is part of my degree requirements. While this is almost certainly past the scope of the class, one thing I'd like to get out of this course, if possible, is coding interview practice.
